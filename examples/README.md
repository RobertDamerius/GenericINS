# Examples
As an example real sensor data from trials with an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) are used.
The vehicle is equipped with the following sensors:
- Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
- Doppler Velocity Log (DVL)
- Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-Receiver
- Attitude-Heading Reference System (AHRS)

The sensor configuration is defined in the `GenericINSParameters` class (see [source](../source/) directory).
There are two ways to run the example - either MATLAB or Simulink.
Make sure your MATLAB/Simulink version is at least R2018b.
The MATLAB example may also work with previous versions.

**MATLAB Example**<br>
Simply run the `ExampleMATLAB.m` script.

**Simulink Example**<br>
Simply run the `ExampleSimulink.m` script.
